# Real vs AI Image Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either real or AI-generated. It is trained on the CIFAKE dataset, which contains synthetic and real-world images.

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Script to train the CNN model.
- `predict.py`: Script to classify a given image.
- `model/`: Stores trained model weights.
- `data/`: Contains training/validation data.
- `samples/`: Example images for testing.

## Future Work

- Add model explainability (e.g., Grad-CAM)
- Deploy using Streamlit or Gradio
- Extend to higher-resolution and larger datasets
- Use ensemble models for better accuracy
